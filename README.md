# XMorse
An app for long distance communication between normal people and deaf-blind(specially-abled) people.

This application uses Morse Code.
In Morse Code, letters are represented as a combination of DOTS(.) and DASHES(-). 
The deafblind person inputs a dot by tapping on the left of the screen, 
dash by tapping on the centre of the screen to form a message and tapping on the right will separate letters of the message and tapping it twice sends the message. 
While, a person with normal sight and hearing can input a message as text which will be received on the database and then to the recieving device which will then convert to a combination of dots and dashes.
A dot will be produced as SHORT VIBRATION and dash which will be produced as a LONG VIBRATION. 
We will be developing a Android mobile application using android studio and Firebase database for the storage of user information. 

The Project uses Firebase for storing messages and transferring them. The messages are saved on the server in English but are sent on the 
reciever end as Morse Language.
